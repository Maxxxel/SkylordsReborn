# Custom Model Tutorial #
This Tutorial describes how to add new Models to Skylords Reborn using the Skylords Reborn Suite.

## Static Models (without Animations) ##
Static Models are an easy thing. You dont need to care for animations and such. You want to use this for props usually.
1. Create or Import a Model in Blender.
2. Import one of the provided base *.glb Models as size reference.
3. Style it and add an UV Map (see [Style Guide](StyleGuide.md)).
4. Remove the size reference model.
5. Export as glb 2.0.
6. Open the file in Skylords Reborn Suite and hit Export.
7. Add the newly created *.drs file and the corresponding *.dds image files to the target folder.
8. Be sure to add the new model to the *.cff file.
